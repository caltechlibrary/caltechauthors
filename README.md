## Introduction

This repository was initialized following [the InvenioRDM
instructions/](https://inveniordm.docs.cern.ch/install). It was then
customized to meet the needs of the Caltech community. This is only one
deployment example, and may or not be appropriate for your specific
institution and IT setup. 

## Installation

We currently deploy CaltechAUTHORS on a m7i.xlarge AWS EC2 instance with Ubuntu
24.04. We use this [cloud-init
file](https://github.com/caltechlibrary/cloud-init-examples/blob/main/invenio-rdm-13-init.yaml)
to do most of the initial setup.

### Install NVM

We haven't gotten NVM to install with cloud-init. Run `curl -o-
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.40.1/install.sh | bash`, then
reboot and type `nvm install 18`

### Install InvenioRDM

cd caltechauthors
invenio-cli install 
invenio-cli services setup --no-demo-data
```

You'll need a .env file in /Sites, which includes secrets:

```
INVENIO_DATACITE_PASSWORD=
INVENIO_SECRET_KEY=
INVENIO_S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID=
INVENIO_S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=
INVENIO_MAIL_PASSWORD=
```

Edit /etc/sysctl.conf and add vm.max_map_count=262144

This configuration uses S3 for storage. You need to change the bucket name with

`pipenv run invenio files location s3-default s3://caltechauthors --default`

### Vocabularies

Load affiliations and funders with the built-in jobs settings in the administration panel.


We have a local awards list, generated by https://github.com/caltechlibrary/irdmtools awards2vocabulary.py. Load into RDM with

```
pipenv run invenio vocabularies import --vocabulary awards --filepath ./vocabularies-future.yaml
```

We have a local CaltechPEOPLE list, which is loaded with

```
pipenv run invenio vocabularies import --vocabulary names --filepath ./vocabularies-future.yaml
```

### Domain Configuration

You'll need a domain name, and set an A record to point the domain name to your
AWS instance.

Move nginx.conf to `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default`

Copy redirect-map.conf to `/etc/nginx/`

Get a certificate with `sudo certbot --nginx`

Restart nginx with `sudo service nginx restart`

### Systemctl

We need three services to run InvenioRDM. Set them up with

```
sudo cp rdm_rest.service /etc/systemd/system/.
sudo cp rdm.service /etc/systemd/system/.
sudo cp rdm_celery.service /etc/systemd/system/.
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl start rdm
sudo systemctl start rdm_rest
sudo systemctl start rdm_celery
```

You should now have a InvenioRDM repository fully running!

## Usage

### Stopping InvenioRDM

```
cd /Sites/caltechauthors
sudo systemctl stop nginx
sudo systemctl stop rdm
sudo systemctl stop rdm_rest
sudo systemctl stop rdm_celery
invenio-cli services stop
```

### Starting InvenioRDM

```
cd /Sites/caltechauthors
invenio-cli services start
sudo systemctl start rdm_celery
sudo systemctl start rdm_rest
sudo systemctl start rdm
sudo systemctl start nginx
```

## Known issues and limitations

These insttallation instructions are intended for this specific Caltech
deployment, and you may need to modify them to work for your specific
